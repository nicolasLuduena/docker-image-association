# Docker Build and Push Workflow Example
This repository demonstrates a GitHub Actions workflow to build, tag, and push Docker images to the GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io). It serves as an example for automating containerized builds and deployment for open-source or private projects.


If you are wondering how to have multiple docker images associated to your repository in ghcr.io. Just push them with a github action. 


That's what I was trying to prove with this.
